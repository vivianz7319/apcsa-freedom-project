# Entry 4
##### 3/17/24

Currently, my partner and I decided to use [ide.cs50.io](https://cs50.dev/) to build our freedom project. Currently we only have code templates and we are still modifying them to meet our needs. Although we haven't done much yet, we'll continue later by modifying some template code with django and find a way to make a flashcard that stores the information the user writes as the questions. My goal, which I plan to do before the next blog entry, is to make an html file to create a web page for our project.

My partner and I gave in our MVP of where we going to start our project and I realized I am really behind from my project. 
I started off by importing starter documents into my IDE and choosing a bootstrap format for my wesbite.
There was a files named:
* asgi.py
* setting.py
* urls.py
* wsgi.py
 Those files has...
1. 
```python
"""
ASGI config for django_project project.

It exposes the ASGI callable as a module-level variable named ``application``.

2.

And I also picked out a website template (it would be too much to put here), but it needs a lot of tweeking to fit what we want it to look like.

When I opened how the HTML of the website looked, I realized there was some issue. The HTML isn't what I expected it to look like. The CSS was not connected to the HTML and I found out why, becasue based off the template the css was put into a different file, which was a minor mistake. I would still need to fix up some parts of the template to make it what we want it to look like, but I did make a html file that would contain what we need to create the webpage. 

Since then, I have used different skills such as attention to detail and collaboration. If I didn't pay attention to the little things, I would panic not knowing what to do, so I think it's a little attention to detail and a growth mindset. Collaboration was essential when I was working on the Freedom Project because I had to work with them and there are certain things that we each do. This is reflected in our MVP plan, where we each have a series of things to do. Although we may miss a deadline, we can work together so that we can each do what we are responsible for in this project of freedom.

Before the next blog entry, I would like to manage my time better and get most of what I need to get done, done. For example using bootstrap to create a carousel that cycles through the flashcards and adding buttons to allow the user to choose the answer/access their flashcards. I would like to catch up on deadline that me and my partner had made.
