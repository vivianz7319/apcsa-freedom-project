# Entry 2
##### 12/11/23

During the last few weeks, my partner Grace and I have been working on our Freedom Project. 
I've started watching a video called [Python for Beginners - Learn Python in 1 Hour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqtD5dpn9C8), in the video it does link a bit infromation on how to use django, but it's mostly about python. Since Django uses the python language, it would be pretty helpful to watch the video. 
Here are somethings I learned:
* Python is the #1 language for machine learning and data science projects, and is very popular in web development.
There's different websites powered with python and django, such as Youtube, Instagram, Spotify, Dropbox, and Pinterest.
With Python you can save time and increase productivity by automating repetitive tasks. Python is for Data Science, Machine Learning, Web Development (popular for using django).

About the variables:<br>
Variables are sued to temporarily store data in a computer's memory. Storing a variable is very easy just like what I learned in JavaScript. Like the example below (please refer if forgotten):
```python
age = 20
print(age)
```
Notice how it's the same as JavaScript, just the print function is different. Something new that I learned is that the program is executed from top to bottom. So if I add `age = 30` on line 2, then it would return me `30` and not `20`. <br> 
In python, you can use numbers with decimal point, or we can choose to use full numbers. <br> 
If we want to delare a variable that has more than 1 word in  the name, we should use a underscore to separate the word, like this `first_name`. When setting a variable that is a string, we can choose to use single quotes or double quotes. <br> 
We are able to just directly set the boolean value as true or fasle, like this `is_online = True`. The `True` and the `False` MUST be capitialized when used. 

About receiving inputs:<br>
We would use anotehr built in function on that is called `input()`, we can ask any question, and then put it equal to an variable. This would save the users input in the variable. 
```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
```
Now this would return the value of teh input function, then we can choose to do something like print a greeting message by using the print function. 
```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello " + name)
```
This is called a string concatenation, we are combining a string with anotehr string. 

I also that it's differnet on how the videos that I would usually ask us to install Django and python into our laptop, but  since we are using replit, we wouldn't be installing django and python on our laptop.  

During these weeks, I learned that I would need the skills "Time Management" and "Attention to Detail". These skills are very important especially when I am learning my tool. I would need Time Management because I've been lackin g on keepng up with my learning log due to all the other classes I have and not saving time to watch the videos. But I did have pay Attention to Detail, if I didn't it probably wouldn't have took me a pretty long time typing out eveything that Iwould need to know in my learning log. My Freedom Project goal for winter break is to at least spend 3-4 hours on learning and watching videos about Django, and get a good grasp of Django so when I come back from break I can start working on tinkering using Django.
