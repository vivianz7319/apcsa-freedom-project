For my Freedom Project, me and my partner, Grace Zhu, deccided that we wanted to make a flashcard/ slide card app or website. This webiste/app is suppose to help students review and study their vocabulary and at least somehow imporve their grade. The people that are choosing to use this app/website can add a list of word they want to study, add their defination, and make quizzes to study those words. The goal of the whole project is to create something that can help students (or anyone in general) study. Grace and I choose the tool Django for our project, Django was recommened as a tool we can make our slide website/app with. The sites that I used to learn Django is, [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/django/) and this [youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVBKjEIdL9bvCdI4l1Emvbezv10GjUaLk) of videos that has a whole course of things I would need to know to use Django. 

Some of my chanlleges was not knwoing where to code and tinker with my tool, since we be doing Java in class, Python is different from Java. Me and my partner never used Python before, so this is something that is new for us, it was veru hard for me to understand django from the webiste, but it did give a lot of background information like model, view, template, and URLs, but it really didn't teach me much about what django really was, or how would I even use it. Grace  said I can use replit to code and tinker with my tool, because replit has almost everything and sure you can use replit but I really don't know how to use Django. Which makes me wonder would watching videos help me with what I need to understand the code. the w3schools website did give:
```django
my_tennis_club
    manage.py
    my_tennis_club/
    members/
        migrations/
            __init__.py
        __init__.py
        admin.py
        apps.py
        models.py
        tests.py
        views.py
```
but lets be honest, I really dont know what that means, I hope that watching the videos would help me gain more knowledge about my tool

For this part of the project, I really need to keep a <b>growth mindset</b>, because I'm starting to give off false hope that I wouldn't be able to complete this project, and I don't want to affect my partner for it either. I feel like we are both on a very difficult road right now, because this is something really new to us. I need to <b>pay attention to details</b>, if I miss any important details I may get very lost and it's going to throw me off track. With these two skills, I learned to not give up before I even start, I learned to accept the fact I am new at something and is willing to give a push and a harder try than just giving up. I hope I keep the positive mindset throught learning Django.
