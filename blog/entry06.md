# Entry 6
##### 6/6/24

So far, my partner and I have completed everything we needed for our website. We utilized collaboration and consideration skills in crafting the elevator pitch for the upcoming expo. Collaboration was particularly crucial for us as we needed to determine what to convey in different parts of the expo and divide the workload evenly between us. Consideration was also vital as we have a limited time to present and aimed to highlight the key aspects of our elevator pitch for the judges.

After that we worked on our presentation slides in class. We used the skills creativity and collabortaion to create our presentation. Creativity was used due to the fact that we wanted our presentation to be clean but at the same time presenatble. Collabortaion is important because we wanted to9 know what each other woild say and we wanted the slide to match our satifcation.
