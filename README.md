# APCSA Freedom Project
by **X**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for AP Computer Science A is a year-long project all about making anything using technology.

For my project, I chose to independently study **Django** in order to help me make **Flashcard Website**.
