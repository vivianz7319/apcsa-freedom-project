Project: **X**

**10/23/23**:
* I first went on the [Django website](https://www.w3schools.com/django/index.php) and looked at the list of tutorials the webiste has on Django. Then I saw the word "URL" and "APP".
* I wanted to create a slide card app that students can use to review their vocabulary, and study for exams. Students can choose to add onto their list of flashcards, and make quizzes for studying.
* My tool is a Python framework that lets us create apps and or webistes.
* AIt follows the MTV (Model View Template)

**10/24/23**:
**Model**: 
* the data is delivered as a object relational mapping (ORM), which is a technique designed to make it easier to work with databases.
* Using ORM would make it easier to communicate with databases without having to write complex SQL statements.
* most common way to extract data from a database is SQL. 
* The models are usually located in a file called `models.py`
  
**10/25/23**:
**View**:
* a function or method that takes http requests as arguments, imports the relevant model(s), and finds out what data to send to the template, and returns the final result.
* The views are usually located in a file called `views.py`
  
**10/27/23**:
**Template**:
* uses HTML layouts with logic, example shown below:
  ```html
  <h1>My Homepage</h1>

  <p>My name is {{ firstname }}.</p>
  ```
* The templates of an application is located in a folder named `templates`
