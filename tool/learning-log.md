# Tool Learning Log

Tool: **Django**

Project: **X**

---

**10/23/23**:
* I first went on the [Django website](https://www.w3schools.com/django/index.php) and looked at the list of tutorials the webiste has on Django. Then I saw the word "URL" and "APP".
* I wanted to create a slide card app that students can use to review their vocabulary, and study for exams. Students can choose to add onto their list of flashcards, and make quizzes for studying.
* My tool is a Python framework that lets us create apps and or webistes.
* AIt follows the MTV (Model View Template)

**10/24/23**:

**Model**: 
* the data is delivered as a object relational mapping (ORM), which is a technique designed to make it easier to work with databases.
* Using ORM would make it easier to communicate with databases without having to write complex SQL statements.
* most common way to extract data from a database is SQL. 
* The models are usually located in a file called `models.py`
  
**10/25/23**:

**View**:
* a function or method that takes http requests as arguments, imports the relevant model(s), and finds out what data to send to the template, and returns the final result.
* The views are usually located in a file called `views.py`
  
**10/27/23**:

**Template**:
* uses HTML layouts with logic, example shown below:
  ```html
  <h1>My Homepage</h1>

  <p>My name is {{ firstname }}.</p>
  ```
* The templates of an application is located in a folder named `templates`

**10/30/23**

**URLS**
* Used to navigate around different pages inside the website.
* When a user requests a URL, Django will bring you to the designated URL.
* The file is called `urls.py`

**11/1/23**

Since I needed to learn more about making an app for my freedom project, I look at the [Django Create App](https://www.w3schools.com/django/django_create_app.php) part of the website. I ama very stressed out right now, becasue the website doesn't say much about how to build an app. But it did tell me that I would need a start app name and a folder to navigate where I would want to locate the information. 
```django
py manage.py startapp members
```
Django will creates a folder named `members` in my project, with this content:
```django
my_tennis_club
    manage.py
    my_tennis_club/
    members/
        migrations/
            __init__.py
        __init__.py
        admin.py
        apps.py
        models.py
        tests.py
        views.py
```
These are all the file with specific meanings. 

**11/2/23**

I realized that I didnt know where to code my project yet, and since the tool Django is python. I found thet replit can code Python and since Django is part of Python, we will be able to use [replit](https://blog.replit.com/deploying-django). 
* Authentication and authorization have been previously incorporated into Django, which means you can focus on writing your app because the basic web development functionality has already been done.
* Replit also allows for real-time collaboration. You can access Replit on any platform that has an active internet connection, and you can edit your code and connect with other developers anytime and anywhere.

If we want the "skeleton" of the webiste we would need to have a `django-admin tool` to generate a project folder, the basic file templates, and manage.py, which serves as the project management script.

**03/10/24**
We recently gave in our MVP of where we going to start our project and I realized I am really behind from my project. 
I started off by importing starter documents into my IDE and choosing a bootstrap format for my wesbite.
There was a files named:
* asgi.py
* setting.py
* urls.py
* wsgi.py
 Those files has...
1. 
```python

And I also picked out a website template (it would be too much to put here), but it needs a lot of tweeking to fit what we want it to look like.
