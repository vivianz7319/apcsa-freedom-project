###### Introduction 
Python is the #1 language for machine learning and data science projects, and is very popular in web development. <br>
There's different websites powered with python and django, such as Youtube, Instagram, Spotify, Dropbox, and Pinterest. <br> 
With Python you can save time and increase productivity by automating repetitive tasks. <br> 
Python is for 
- Data Science
- Machine Learning
- Web Development (popular for using django)

###### First Step
This person is installing the python on their laptop, but I'm not going to download it becasue I would be working on my project on replit. <br>
From what I saw in the video the man made a application python, then he proceeds to create a string inside the print function that he made like this, `print("Hello World")`<br> 
Then he shows us how to run the code, but since I would be using replit, there would be a run buton to where I would press and run my code. <br> 

###### Variables 
Variables are sued to temporarily store data in a computer's memory. Storing a variable is very easy just like what I learned in JavaScript. Like the example below (please refer if forgotten):
```python
age = 20
print(age)
```
Notice how it's the same as JavaScript, just the print function is different. Something new that I learned is that the program is executed from top to bottom. So if I add `age = 30` on line 2, then it would return me `30` and not `20`. <br> 
In python, you can use numbers with decimal point, or we can choose to use full numbers. <br> 
If we want to delare a variable that has more than 1 word in  the name, we should use a underscore to separate the word, like this `first_name`. When setting a variable that is a string, we can choose to use single quotes or double quotes. <br> 
We are able to just directly set the boolean value as true or fasle, like this `is_online = True`. The `True` and the `False` MUST be capitialized when used. 
###### Exercise 1 
* We check in a paitient named John Smith
* He is 20 years old
* He is a new patient
I need to create variables to store these values. 
```python
name = "John Smith"
age = 20
new_patient = True
```
This is what I wrote for the exercise. 
###### Receiving Inputs 
We woulduse anotehr built in function on that is called `input()`, we can ask any question, and then put it equal to an variable. This would save the users input in the variable. 
```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
```
Now this would return the value of teh input function, then we can choose to do something like print a greeting message by using the print function. 
```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello " + name)
```
This is called a string concatenation, we are combining a string with anotehr string.
